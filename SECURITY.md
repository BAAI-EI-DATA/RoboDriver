# Security Policy

We take security issues seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1) GitHub Security Advisories (preferred): open a private advisory from the repository Security tab so maintainers can triage confidentially.
2) If unavailable, open a minimal public issue titled "[SECURITY] <short summary>" without sensitive details; maintainers will follow up.

Please include: affected versions/commits, environment, reproduction steps, impact, and any proposed mitigations.

We aim to acknowledge within 3 business days and provide a remediation plan or status update within 14 days.
